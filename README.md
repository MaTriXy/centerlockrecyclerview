Center Lock RecyclerView
This is a recyclerview scroll listener implementation that has a center locking (auto rescroll to center) feature in horizontal mode.

 
 
 Note : 1) User is responsible for providing the intial and final paddings to the first and last items of the list as these need to be centered when user scrolls completely in either direction.
